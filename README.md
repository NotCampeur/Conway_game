# LIFE'S GAME

The project aim to recreate the Conway's game in Cpp using SDL2

# The rules:
    -Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
    -Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    -Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
    -Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# This program is supported on linux
